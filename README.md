# Burn-Victim-Survival-Analysis
We apply the use of statistical techniques and methods of survival analysis to model the 
time till a staphylococcus aureus infection of burned subjects. Our data comes from a burn unit 
at a large Midwestern university. We apply the use of a Kaplan-Meier estimate to calculate probabilities of a 
patient suffering from an excision. We also compare survival rates for both women and men to find 
a difference between both groups as we expect their respective hazard functions to be different. 
We also apply this method to the type of burn type, and to the ethnicity of a patient. The use of 
ratio-test and log likelihoods are used to find significant differences in the data. Finally, we 
employ the use of a Cox Proportional Hazard model to model staphylococcus infection using various 
covariates and we conducted diagnostic checks on our model in order to deem it valid
